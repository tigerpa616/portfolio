# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website I created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I used the ReactJS framework for my Javascript as well as the TailwindCSS framework for my CSS

This website will be hosted through GitHub Pages to allow other people the oppurtunity to have a more visual representation of my portfolio, instead of just reading my resume.
